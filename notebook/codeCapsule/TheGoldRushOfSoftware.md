# The Gold Rush of Software

> [The Gold Rush of Software | Code Capsule](https://codecapsule.com/2010/09/23/gold-rush-software/)

During the Gold Rush of California in 1849, thousands of men were ready to put at stake all they had in the hope of a better life. The software industry that we are currently experiencing shows, to a certain extent, very similar patterns. Smartphone and source code have replaced the traditional pick and scoop, however the goals and hopes remained the same. But is there anything for developers to expect from this gold rush of software?

## James Lick and the California Gold Rush of 1849

As he was building a saw mill, James Marshall discovered gold in California’s American River. That was in January 1848. By Spring 1849, 30,000 men were already digging in the mud looking for gold. Pennsylvania-born James Licks arrived in California in January 1848, a bit before gold was discovered, with entrepreneurial ambitions. Like many, he took part in the Gold Rush of 1849, which made his fortune. The life of gold diggers was just horrible. Instead of a fast buck, most of them just found hunger and misery, living and sleeping in the same mud that they were digging. Some got limbs amputated, and many caught diseases due to the terrible hygiene conditions. Sure, digging required some skills, but a good part of finding gold was just pure luck. And so, some random guy would find a huge gold nugget every once in a while, return home as a rich man, and this one in a million man was enough to keep the gold fever alive among diggers. But James Lick was not one of these one in a million lucky men, for he was not a gold digger. He actually quit digging after a week. So you are wondering how he got rich? Very simple, he understood that he wouldn’t make his fortune by digging, but by owning the land and by offering services to the diggers, such as food and every-day necessary items. When everybody was rushing for some sad stupid dream — the hope of an instantaneous better life — he was just standing on the side, witness to the madness of man.

> ‎詹姆斯·马歇尔在建造锯木厂时，在加利福尼亚的美国河发现了黄金。那是在1848年1月。到1849年春天，30，000人已经在泥泞中挖金子。出生于宾夕法尼亚州的詹姆斯·利克斯（James Licks）于1848年1月抵达加利福尼亚州，比发现黄金早了一点，怀着创业的雄心壮志。像许多人一样，他参加了1849年的淘金热，这让他发了财。淘金者的生活太可怕了。他们中的大多数人没有快速赚钱，而是找到了饥饿和痛苦，在他们正在挖掘的泥泞中生活和睡觉。有些人截肢，许多人由于可怕的卫生条件而患上了疾病。当然，挖掘需要一些技能，但寻找黄金的很大一部分只是纯粹的运气。所以，一些随机的家伙每隔一段时间就会发现一个巨大的金块，以富人的身份回家，而这个百万分之一的人足以让金热在挖掘者中存活下来。但詹姆斯·利克并不是百万分之一的幸运儿之一，因为他不是一个淘金者。他实际上在一周后停止了挖掘。所以你想知道他是如何致富的？很简单，他明白他不会通过挖掘来发财，而是通过拥有土地和为挖掘者提供服务，例如食物和日常必需品。当每个人都在为一些悲伤的愚蠢梦想而奔波时——希望过上一个瞬间更好的生活——他只是站在一旁，见证着人类的疯狂。

## The High-Tech Gold Rush

Gold rushes still exist in our modern world, just take Las Vegas for instance. More surprising, gold rushes also exist in the software development industry. In one of his column from 1999, Steve McConnell stated:

> The advent of a major new technology often means the beginning of what I think of as a “software gold rush” […] characterized by high-risk, high-reward development practices.

Nowadays gold rushes are not about digging in the mud or loosing your leg. For software, they are about burning your time and money (and also your eyes) programming on a computer. Just think about it. We always hear about the same success stories, the ones with high school kids programming some farting or snowing application on smartphone, and making thousands of dollars with it. There are also these stories of these college buddies who made a website in the dorms, who got funded and moved to San Francisco, and who are now richer than you and your whole family over ten generations. These success stories are sufficient to make us keep up on the dream that we are going to get rich some day. Therefore we try, by spending the time and money we have on that dream. A lot of projects are aborted before they are released, but many, many projects are also released and just fail. Indeed, we rarely hear about the other side: how many guys spent their whole summer working on an application or a website, released it, and failed? How many guys lost their girlfriends and jobs because they were working too much on some personal projects? Sure we are not in the 1800s anymore, but it is all about the same things. In 1849 they were digging in the mud, now we are digging in the code. You are going to tell me: “but this is totally different, gold digging is all about luck, whereas making a startup is all about skills and how smart you are.” Really? Then what is wrong with your applications and websites? Your ideas are good, you implement them correctly and you promote them well, but you are still not rich. That’s because the “skill” part of the deal makes us forget about the chance factor. I am pretty sure that the gold diggers of 1849 were all convinced that gold digging was all about skills. Don’t get me wrong, it is always good to try new ideas — and I am the first one on that — but it is also good sometimes to take a little distance from the digging fever, and put your time and money in the safest long-time investments, such as family and friends.

> ‎淘金热仍然存在于我们的现代世界，以拉斯维加斯为例。更令人惊讶的是，软件开发行业也存在淘金热。在他1999年的一篇专栏文章中，史蒂夫·麦康奈尔说：‎
>
>> ‎一项重大新技术的出现通常意味着我所认为的“软件淘金热”的开始[...]，其特点是高风险，高回报的开发实践。‎
>>
>
> ‎如今，淘金热不是在泥泞中挖土或失去你的腿。对于软件来说，它们是关于在计算机上燃烧你的时间和金钱（以及你的眼睛）编程。想想看。我们总是听到同样的成功故事，那些高中生在智能手机上编程一些放屁或下雪的应用程序，并用它赚了数千美元。还有这些大学伙伴的故事，他们在宿舍里做了一个网站，他们得到了资助并搬到了旧金山，现在比你和你整个家庭更富有了十代人。这些成功的故事足以让我们跟上有一天会致富的梦想。因此，我们尝试，把我们拥有的时间和金钱花在这个梦想上。很多项目在发布之前就被中止了，但是很多很多项目也被发布，只是失败了。事实上，我们很少听到另一面：有多少人花了整个夏天在应用程序或网站上工作，发布了它，但失败了？有多少男人因为在某些个人项目上工作太多而失去了女朋友和工作？当然，我们不再是1800年代了，但这一切都是关于同样的事情。1849年，他们在泥泞中挖掘，现在我们正在挖掘代码。你会告诉我：“但这是完全不同的，淘金是为了运气，而创业则完全取决于技能和你有多聪明。真？那么您的应用程序和网站有什么问题呢？你的想法是好的，你正确地实施了它们，你很好地推广了它们，但你仍然没有富有。这是因为交易的“技能”部分让我们忘记了机会因素。我很确定1849年的淘金者都相信淘金就是为了技巧。不要误会我的意思，尝试新想法总是好的——我是第一个这样做的人——但有时也要远离挖掘热潮，把你的时间和金钱放在最安全的长期投资上，比如家人和朋友。‎

## The Jackpot

James Lick led the way: the big money is not in digging, but in digging services. Let’s take an example. Some big technology company builds a new device, and creates an App Store for this device. You want to develop applications on it, because you are smart and you believe that you can easily get rich. Therefore you buy one or even two of these devices, and you also pay for a developer license in order to publish on the App Store. You make a couple of applications, that always take you more time to developed than planned, and that are not selling that well. Every once in a while, you read a blog post about some obscure application that made $50,000 and this keeps your code fever alive. So you buy the new version of the device, and you renew your developer license. But are you getting rich? If yes, congratulations, you are not only smart, you are also part of the one in a million lucky guys out there! And if not, then ask yourself: who is getting rich? As says Blondie, in Sergio Leone’s film  *The Good, the Bad and the Ugly* :

> You see in this world there’s two kinds of people my friend – those with loaded guns, and those who dig. You dig.

> ‎詹姆斯·利克一路领先：大笔资金不在于挖掘，而在于挖掘服务。让我们举个例子。一些大型科技公司建造了一台新设备，并为该设备创建了一个App Store。你想在上面开发应用程序，因为你很聪明，你相信你可以很容易地致富。因此，您购买了其中一个甚至两个设备，并且还支付了开发人员许可证才能在App Store上发布。你做了几个应用程序，这些应用程序总是比计划花费更多的时间来开发，而且卖得不是那么好。每隔一段时间，你就会读到一篇关于一些晦涩难懂的应用程序的博客文章，这些应用程序赚了50，000美元，这让你的代码狂热继续存在。因此，您购买了设备的新版本，并续订了开发人员许可证。但是你致富了吗？如果是，恭喜你，你不仅聪明，你也是百万分之一的幸运家伙的一部分！如果没有，那就问问自己：谁在致富？正如金发女郎在塞尔吉奥·莱昂内的电影‎*‎《好、坏和丑陋》中‎*‎所说：‎
